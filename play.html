    <h1>Sai Kishore Chowdam</h1>
    <h2>An Ideal Husband</h2>
    <h5>Act 1 - _The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square_.</h5>
    <p>
        
        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5> 
        <p class="speech">Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5> 
        <p class="speech"> I suppose so.  Are you?</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5> 
         <p class="speech">I come here to be educated.</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5> 
         <p class="speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5>  
        <p class="speech">So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come here to try to find one.</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>  
        <p class="speech">I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
        The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5>  
        <p class="speech">How very trivial of him!</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5>  
        <p class="speech">About myself.</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Languidly_.]</p> 
        <p class="speech"> And were you interested?</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Shaking her head_.]</p> 
        <p class="speech"> Not in the smallest degree.</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5>  
        <p class="speech">What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Rising_.]</p> 
        <p class="speech">  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5>  
        <p class="speech">I dont think her able to work Marchmont!</p>

        <h5 class="name MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h5>  
        <p class="speech">Yeah.! I will see later Basildon</p>

        <h5 class="name BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h5> 
        <p class="speech">Okay.!</p>
