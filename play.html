        _The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_.<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
        go anywhere.<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
        here to try to find one.<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
        anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
        The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
        time.<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  About myself.<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  [_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!<br>

        LADY BASILDON.  I dont think her able to work Mrs. Marchmont!<br>

        MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yeah.! I will see later Basildon<br>

        LADY BASILDON. Okay.! <br>
